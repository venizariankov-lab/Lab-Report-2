/*  

Arduino PB (PB) Input Pull-Up program code 

Goal of the program : When the PB is pressed, it's value is 0. When PB is not pressed, it's value is 1. Exactly the same as the Arduino Push Button (PB) Pull-Up, but the resistance is internal instead of external. 

Theme: Digital Input

int pushButton = 7; // Have pin 7 of the arduino associated with the PB  

 
 

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board     

void setup() {   

 
 

pinMode(pushButton,INPUT); //PB is set as a Input   

 
 

Serial.begin(9600); //Create connection to the serial monitor 

}   

 
 

// the loop function runs over and over again forever     

void loop() {   

  

int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton); //read the value of PB as buttonstate   

 
 

Serial.print("buttonState = "); //prints onto the serial monitor " buttonState = "   

 
 

Serial.println(buttonState); //prints the value of buttonState and then starts a new line on the serial monitor   

 
 

delay(1); //gives a delay of 1ms in between each print in the serial monitor
