 Goal of the program : Turns an LED on for one second, then off for two seconds, repeatedly. 

 Themes : Digital Output

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board 

void setup() { 

  // initialize digital pin 13 as an output. 

  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

  delay(1000);                      // Keeps the LED on HIGH for 1 second 

  digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // turn the LED on LOW, meaning off. This is done by setting the pin 13 to a logic LOW (0V)
