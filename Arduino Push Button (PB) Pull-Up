/*  

Arduino Push Button (PB) Pull-Up program code 

Goal of the program : Have the push button display 0 on the serial monitor when it's pressed and 1 when not 

Theme : Digital Input

int pushButton = 7; // Associating the PB with pin 10  

 
 

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board   

void setup() {  

 

pinMode(pushButton,INPUT); //PB is set as an Input  

 

Serial.begin(9600); //Create connection to the serial monitor  

 
 

}  

 
 

// the loop function runs over and over again forever   

void loop() {  

 
 

int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton); //read the value of PB as buttonstate  

 
 

Serial.print("buttonState = "); //prints onto the serial monitor "buttonState =" 

 
 

Serial.println(buttonState); //prints the value of buttonState and then starts a new line on the serial monitor 

 
 

delay(1); //gives a delay of 1ms in between each print in the serial monitor
